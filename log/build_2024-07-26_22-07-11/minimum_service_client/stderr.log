[31mCMake Error at CMakeLists.txt:17 (find_package):
  By not providing "Findminimum_srv.cmake" in CMAKE_MODULE_PATH this project
  has asked CMake to find a package configuration file provided by
  "minimum_srv", but CMake did not find one.

  Could not find a package configuration file provided by "minimum_srv" with
  any of the following names:

    minimum_srvConfig.cmake
    minimum_srv-config.cmake

  Add the installation prefix of "minimum_srv" to CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH or set
  "minimum_srv_DIR" to a directory containing one of the above files.  If
  "minimum_srv" provides a separate development package or SDK, be sure it
  has been installed.
